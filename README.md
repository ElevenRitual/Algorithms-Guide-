Certainly! Here's a list of common string processing algorithms used by competitive programmers:

| Algorithm                | Description                                                                                                       |
|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| String Matching         | Algorithms to find occurrences of a substring within a string, like Naive, Rabin-Karp, Knuth-Morris-Pratt, etc. |
| Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) | Finding the longest subsequence present in given two sequences of strings.                                    |
| Longest Palindromic Substring | Finding the longest substring of a string that is also a palindrome.                                           |
| Edit Distance           | Determining the minimum number of operations (insertion, deletion, substitution) to transform one string into another. |
| Trie                     | A tree-like data structure used to store a dynamic set of strings for efficient prefix searching.                |
| Suffix Array             | An array of all suffixes of a string sorted in lexicographical order, useful in pattern searching.             |
| Z Algorithm              | Efficient algorithm to find all occurrences of a pattern in a string.                                          |
| Manacher's Algorithm     | Finding all palindromic substrings in linear time.                                                              |

These algorithms are commonly used in competitive programming for various string manipulation tasks. Each algorithm has its strengths and is suited to different types of problems.
